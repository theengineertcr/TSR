1.1 Notes


SWAT 4: The Suspects revenge is one of my first SWAT 4 mods and aims to please the PvP crowd who'd like to practice solo.
You play through the multiplayer versions of each map in campaign order while in the boots of a suspect. All equipment
is unlocked and all maps have 3 objectives:Killing or arresting officers, capturing the VIP and reactivating the bombs.
Mod is not compatible with The Stetchkov Syndicate DLC and is based on the patched version of the original release.
Should be multiplayer compatible - although has not been tested.


1.2 Installation:


Place the TSR folder found inside the zip file in the SWAT 4 folder - alongside the Content folder. If that folder
is not present, the mod will not work. Additionally, this mod was created for SWAT 4 Version 1.1. May not be
compatible with version 1.0.


1.3 Changelog:


Ver 1.0.

First stable version of the mod!
New enemy archetype: EnemySwatOfficer
Spawns with Light Body Armor
Spawns with either a flash protective helmet or gas mask
Spawns with a random primary weapon from multiplayer
Chance to spawn with low ammunition, swapping to backup after a couple of bursts


End of log.
